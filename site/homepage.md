# Binky

**Tagline:** Binky sorts your files.

A native macOS sorter that follows your rules — no cloud, no guessing. **Quick Sort** tidies a fussy folder in one tap; **Routines** watch continuously with the same routing logic. Binky waits for files to finish landing, then sorts them into sensible sorted folders — Images, PDFs, Media, Documents, Archives, Apps, Screenshots, Misc. Source-aware routing, plain-English rules, receipt detection, duplicate guard, smart screenshot names, optional housekeeping (stale-file aging), daily and optional weekly digest reminders, and a shareable weekly digest card from history. Unknowns route to **Review** so nothing sketchy silently disappears. Optional Finder tags; history with reveal and undo where macOS allows.

## Highlights

- **Quick Sort** — one-tap sweep for any inbox (defaults to `~/Downloads`); waits for downloads to finish, collision-safe moves
- **Routines** — named watchers with their own sources, rules, and optional Finder tags; plain-English rule building on macOS 26+
- **Source-aware routing** — match by download origin and content, not just filename
- **Receipt & invoice detection** — routes financial PDFs when content looks like a receipt
- **Duplicate guard** — hashing before files settle
- **Shortcuts** — “Sort Files” App Intent passes paths to the running app
- **Daily & weekly digest** — optional notifications; weekly share card (PNG) from session history
- **Review folder** — ambiguous types land here first
- **History** — batch summaries; undo where possible
